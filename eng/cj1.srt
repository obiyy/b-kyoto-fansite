1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:08,460
oh this season was pretty good um

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,320
we accomplished a lot of goals made a

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,420
lot of history so extremely best to be a

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,040
part of this team and part of this

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,240
organization we did a lot of great

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,320
things

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,900
we fell short in both but it's part of

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,400
the game and it's going to help us grow

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,740
as players and hopefully the next time

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,820
we make it

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,840
we could be able to win

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,719
I think we just

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,360
did couldn't put 40 minutes of our type

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,640
of basketball up

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,860
you know um it's tough when you're

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,960
playing good teams

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,460
it's the people that can make the most

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,440
runs and the most important run and we

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,079
were just not able to do that

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,640
um

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,960
if we would have put up to 40 minutes

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,300
there's no down my mind we've been won

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,039
you know so um

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,440
just gotta figure out what we could do

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,780
better you know but um

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,579
for the most part I just don't think we

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,820
put the whole 40 minutes up of

28
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,100
the Oklahoma B card series basketball so

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,400
that's that's my reasoning why we came

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,500
up short and well we had the results

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,220
that we had

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,720
um

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,159
I feel like the main thing I've been

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,799
thinking is uh the team goals our team

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,360
goes and um just my teammates you know

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,220
my main thing was always to go out there

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,900
and fight hard for my teammates and um

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,939
we all had the same goal so it made me

39
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,020
want to go out there and go harder

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,100
because

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,659
I knew my teammates was going hard and

42
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,079
it was all competing for that same goal

43
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,140
so I feel like that's why that's what

44
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,579
made me you know what I'm saying play

45
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,740
the way I'm playing

46
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,700
pretty much yeah

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,280
um I feel like um the memorable game I

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
can't put in this one memorable game

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,479
because we made so much history this

50
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,259
year

51
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,000
and that would be hard for me to do I

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
just feel like this whole season for me

53
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,720
was very memorable for me because just

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,440
everything we did and how we just came

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,540
in and shocked everybody

56
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,099
we ain't shock ourselves we shocked

57
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,180
everybody else that really didn't

58
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,160
believe in US

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,879
um

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,060
so it's kind of hard but I always say

61
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,680
the emperor's cup was like just that

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,300
whole Emperor's cup that whole thing we

63
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,700
I feel like that was very memorable

64
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,459
um like I said when we beat brex I feel

65
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,200
like when we first beat breaks in the

66
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,520
beginning of the year we was just like

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,800
even in the preseason we tie with them

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,840
and then we beat we ended up beating

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,560
them

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,599
in our minds I felt like that was the

71
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,940
that was a point where we was like we

72
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,440
can be a really good team we could be

73
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,760
the best team in this league if we

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,019
wanted to if we just play our basketball

75
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,060
we could be the best team so

76
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,500
I would say well that was one of them

77
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,580
but I really can't give you one

78
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,080
or one moment that was the best because

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,340
I feel like this whole season was just

80
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,519
great

81
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,580
when my wife and my son decided to come

82
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,400
to my game right after like like a week

83
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,500
or so after they were like after she was

84
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,940
done pregnant being pregnant and stuff

85
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,400
so like maybe like that next month

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,200
she kind of surprised me by coming to

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,760
the game I don't remember what gaming

88
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,959
was but

89
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,280
I feel like that was the most memorable

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,319
for me because like she showed how

91
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,120
strong she was as a woman because I know

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,340
she was in a lot of pain but she wanted

93
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,260
to support me and

94
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,879
she knew how much that would have meant

95
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,620
to me and that meant a lot because I was

96
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,300
able my son was able to see me for the

97
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,640
first time playing basketball and

98
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,620
I knew she was in a lot of pain but she

99
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,180
just

100
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,640
she just show so much courage and you

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,040
know to decide to come out and watch me

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,019
play that that following game when I

103
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,400
knew she was in a lot of pain I just

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,739
that meant so much to me so that I feel

105
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,599
like that was uh when she the first game

106
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,799
she was able to come out I feel like

107
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,019
that was the most memorable game for me

108
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,280
um

109
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,019
I don't know if it was uh I don't

110
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,239
remember exactly when it was

111
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,299
um

112
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,040
I'm not sure but

113
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,540
it was the end of maybe the end of

114
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,060
December but I feel like that that game

115
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,739
that she came decided to come was the

116
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,700
most memorable for me though

117
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,479
I mean I guess I could stay in my career

118
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,540
high when I scored what 30 30 something

119
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,520
points uh I don't know I forgot who it

120
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,500
was against was it against Shibuya

121
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,860
I think it was Shibuya um I'll say just

122
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,380
my career high against Shibuya

123
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,540
was my former team so it was cool to

124
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,820
kick their butt and um

125
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,740
you know that was my career high so

126
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,860
that's a blessing um it was a fun game I

127
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,720
think Yuki we didn't I don't know I

128
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,979
don't think I think I was one of the

129
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,500
games Yuki was out so

130
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,780
it was kind of tough we didn't know what

131
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,880
to expect but we was able to go out

132
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,400
there and fight hard and get to Victory

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
still so that was that was like my most

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,300
memorable game stat wise

135
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,300
